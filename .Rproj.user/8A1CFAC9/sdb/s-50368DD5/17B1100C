It is noted that age group\"1-5yrs\" had the highest number of admissions of 26382 while the least admitted age group was that of \"16-20yrs\".\n```{r,comment=NA}\ntable(admissions$age_cat)\n\n```\nA graph of general admissions aganist age group.\n\n```{r,echo=FALSE}\nc<-ggplot(admissions[!is.na(admissions$age_cat),],aes(factor(age_cat)))\nc<-c+geom_bar()\nc<-c+geom_bar(fill=\"limegreen\",colour=\"blue\")\nc<-c+labs(x=\"AGE GROUP\",y=\"ADMISSIONS COUNT\")\nc<-c+ggtitle(\"Admissions according to Age Group\")\nc\n```\nFrom the above tables and graphs I came up with the following assumptions:\n```{r}\n```\n  -Since there was a high admission in the month of January it is assumed that  it is due to the extreme temperatures experienced during that month hence causing skin infections especially to young children in this case ages 1-5yrs.\n -Also the admissions may be as a result of dusty winds which are a normal occurrence in this month. These weather conditions increases the chances of patients under the said age group risk of suffering from respiratory  diseases like asthma.\n\n```{r}\n```\n  -It is also noted that from the months of May to July there was a slight increase in the number of admissions. I assumed that it is due to the cold and rainy weather experienced during these times of the year.The age group that had high admissions during these particular months are those between \"1-5yrs\" simply because their body immune system is still very weak hence they cannot cope with the low temperatures. Most of them stand a risk of getting respiratory infections like pneumonia. \n```{r}\n```\n   -The increased admissions may also be assumed to be because of the high risk that      children especially in this age group (1-5yrs) face on Malarial infection that is at its highest during the rainy seasons.\n```{r}\n```\n\n\nBelow are tables and plots of the MONTHLY ADMISSIONS count aganist AGE GROUPS for each month.I generated them using a for loop control structure.\n```{r,echo=FALSE,comment=NA}\nadmissions$k <-month(admissions$date_admn)#introduction of a new object\"k\"(Int)\n\nfor (i in 1:12) {\n  \n  print(table(admissions$age_cat[admissions$k==i]))\n  \n  mnth1<-month.name[i]\n  title<- paste(mnth1,\"admission\")\n  \n  c5<-ggplot(admissions[admissions$k==i &!is.na(admissions$age_cat),],aes(factor(age_cat))) \n  c5<-c5+geom_bar()\n  c5<-c5+geom_bar(fill=\"brown\",colour=\"yellow\")\n  c5<-c5+labs(x=\"AGE GROUP\",y=\"ADMISSIONS COUNT\")\n  c5<-c5+ggtitle(title)\n  c5<-c5+theme_bw()\n  print(c5)\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
